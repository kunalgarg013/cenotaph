\label{cap:1}

\vspace*{2cm}


\section{Standard Model}
\label{cap:1.1}
Short description of the standard model of elementary particle physics


\section{Quantum Chromodynamics and Quark-Gluon Plasma}
\label{cap:1.2}
Here we describe the theory of QCD and the physics of Quark Gluon Plasma

\section{Heavy-Ion Physics}
\label{cap:1.3}
Heavy-ion collisions is the realm where we can probe the properties of the quark gluon plasma

\section{Physics of Small systems}
\label{cap:1.4}
The physics in pp collisions is important for nuclear physics to set a baseline for the heavy-ion physics
