In this thesis the measurement of the multi-strange baryon production in \PbPb\ and \pp\ collisions at the centre-of-mass energy of \mbox{$2.76$ TeV} using the \mbox{ALICE} apparatus have been presented. The cascade identification technique, based on the topological reconstruction of weak decays into charged particles, has been described. Such a technique is very effective thanks to the excellent particle identification and tracking capability of the ALICE central barrel detectors.
