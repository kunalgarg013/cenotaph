\chapter{$K^{*0}$ and $K^{*\pm}$ resonance reconstruction in pp collisions}
\label{cap:4}


\vspace*{2cm}
Short lived resonances are good probes to study the properties of strongly interacting matter produced in high energy heavy ion collisions.


\section{Signal Extraction}
\label{cap:4.1}
We describe how hadronic resonances are usually reconstructed from the raw data

\subsection{Uncorrelated background estimate}
\label{cap:4.1a}
Description of event mixing, like-sign and rotating background


\section{$K^{*\pm}$ Mass Determination}
\label{cap:4.2}
$K^{*\pm}$ mass has been extracted using the following procedure.
